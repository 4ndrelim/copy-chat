The food industry has been pushing us to eat more and more processed foods, which are loaded with sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. These foods are not only bad for our health, but they also contribute to the obesity epidemic. We need to start eating more whole foods and less processed foods. This will help us lose weight and improve our overall health.
The food industry is also responsible for the rise in childhood obesity. They target children with their marketing campaigns, and they make it easy for kids to get their hands on unhealthy snacks. We need to protect our children from this kind of predatory marketing. We need to teach them how to make healthy choices when it comes to food. And we need to make sure that the food they have access to is good for them.
We can do this by supporting local farmers and small businesses. When we buy locally grown produce, we're supporting our economy and helping to create jobs. We're also getting fresh, nutritious food that's better for us than anything you'll find at a big box store.

The MOU will help ensure that federal agencies work together to protect and restore the Great Lakes.
The GLRI is a $475 million federal investment to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes ecosystem. The initiative focuses on key ecological priorities including: cleaning up toxics and areas of concern, combating invasive species, promoting nearshore health by protecting watersheds from polluted runoff, restoring wetlands and other coastal habitat, and working with partners on outreach and education. The GLRI also includes a strong commitment to accountability and transparency, with annual performance reports to Congress and the public.
The MOU was signed at the Great Lakes Commission meeting in Chicago, Illinois. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are three of the 16 federal agencies that have committed to working together to implement the GLRI. The MOU will help ensure that federal agencies work together to protect and restore the Great Lakes. It will also help ensure that federal agencies coordinate their activities with state, local, tribal, and non-governmental partners to achieve the goals of the GLRI.
The MOU establishes a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, which will be chaired by the Council on Environmental Quality and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The task force will coordinate the federal agencies' efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes. The task force will also oversee the development of an annual report to Congress and the public on the progress of the GLRI. The task force will also develop a biennial action plan for the GLRI. The first action plan will be developed in 2011. The MOU also establishes a Great Lakes Interagency Committee, which will serve as the primary forum for interagency coordination. The committee will include representatives from each of the 16 federal agencies that are participating in the GLRI. The committee will meet quarterly to discuss issues related to the GLRI and to coordinate agency activities.
