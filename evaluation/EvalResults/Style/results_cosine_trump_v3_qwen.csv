But no, he’s back at it again, and this time he’s going after the Democrats’ favorite whipping boy: President Donald Trump.
In a new ad that is set to air in swing states like Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, the former Republican presidential candidate takes aim at the president for his “contemptible” handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
The ad, which you can watch above, features clips of Trump from the early days of the pandemic, when he downplayed the threat of the virus and said it would “go away.” The ad also includes clips of the president saying he didn’t want to shut down the country, and that the U.S. would be open for business by Easter.
The ad then cuts to footage of the president now, as he faces the consequences of his earlier decisions. It shows him wearing a mask and giving a speech from the White House Rose Garden, where he announced the end of the federal eviction moratorium.
Trump has been under fire from both sides of the aisle for his handling of the pandemic. Some Republicans have criticized him for not doing enough to help states and cities deal with the crisis, while Democrats have accused him of being slow to act and failing to take the virus seriously.
In the ad, Romney says that Trump’s “contemptible” response to the pandemic has cost thousands of lives and trillions of dollars. He also says that the president’s actions have put the country on the path to economic ruin.
Romney, who is running for re-election in Utah, has been a vocal critic of Trump since he endorsed Joe Biden for president last month. He has also called for the impeachment of the president over his handling of the pandemic.
The ad comes as Democrats are pushing hard to keep control of the Senate in November. They need to flip three seats to gain a majority, and they are targeting several Republican incumbents in swing states. Romney is one of those targets, and he is facing a tough challenge from former Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski.
The ad is part of a larger effort by Democrats to paint Romney as a moderate who is out of step with the rest of the party. They hope to use his endorsement of Biden to convince voters that he is not a true conservative and that he is more interested in protecting his own political future than standing up for the principles of the Republican Party.
Romney has tried to distance himself from Trump in recent months, but he has stopped short of endorsing Biden or any other Democratic candidate.

The city is on pace to surpass that number before the end of the year. Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said the city could see as many as 360 murders by the end of December.

He also encouraged people to get involved in their communities and mentor young people. He said it’s important to give kids alternatives to joining gangs and getting involved in crime. He said the city can’t arrest its way out of this problem. It will take everyone working together to fix it. He said the city has to change the culture. He said there are too many people who don’t want to get involved and don’t care about what’s happening around them.
