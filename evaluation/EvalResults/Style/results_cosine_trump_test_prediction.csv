RT @jacobkschneider: Boston Herald endorses President,TBA,"Trump. It’s the first major newspaper to do so. https://t.co/0z2573Q9X6
The tweet above is from Jacob Schneider, a political reporter for The New York Times. In it, he references an endorsement of President Donald Trump by the Boston Herald, which is a local newspaper in Massachusetts.
It's worth noting that endorsements from newspapers are often seen as important indicators of public opinion and can influence readers' views on political candidates. However, it's also important to keep in mind that endorsements are not always representative of the entire population or even the majority of a newspaper's readership.
In this case, the Boston Herald is the first major newspaper to endorse President Trump, which may be seen as significant given the generally Democratic leanings of many media outlets in the state of Massachusetts. However, it's important to note that the Herald is a conservative-leaning paper, and its endorsement of Trump may not necessarily reflect the views of other newspapers or the general public in the state. #BostonHerald #DonaldTrump #NewspaperEndorsement","RT @jacobkschneider: Boston Herald endorses President Trump.

Would you say this review depicts the movie in a positive or negative light?
This review depicts the movie in a somewhat positive light. The reviewer acknowledges that the premise of the movie (a man who can't get an erection) isn't inherently funny and might seem like it couldn't possibly be a good movie. However, they express that they found it surprisingly enjoyable, laughing out loud at several scenes. They also state that while it's not a great movie, it's not terrible either, and they're glad they watched it. Overall, the tone is more positive than negative, with the reviewer finding value in the film despite its unconventional subject matter. So, it leans towards a positive depiction, albeit with some reservations.","You would think there is NO WAY that any of these could be considered a good movie.

"“We have a booming economy, and working people",TBA,"are struggling to keep up,” said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY), who introduced the bill.
The bill would raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2016, then tie future increases to inflation. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the measure would lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty, while also reducing the number of low-wage workers.
The bill has 23 cosponsors in the House and 14 in the Senate. It’s unlikely to pass this year, but Yarmuth said he hopes it will be considered again next year.
“While we’re not going to get it done this year, I think we can build on the momentum that we’ve seen over the last couple of years,” he said.
The bill is part of a growing movement to raise the minimum wage. Last month, Seattle became the first major city in the country to approve a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio recently announced plans to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2018.
In Kentucky, the state minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, which is the same as the federal minimum. The state does not allow localities to set their own minimum wages.","“We have a booming economy, and working people are struggling to keep up,” said Rep.

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is the updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was signed in 1994. The USMCA is a trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada that aims to modernize and strengthen the economic relationship between the three countries.
The USMCA includes provisions on a range of issues, including trade in goods and services, intellectual property, labor rights, environmental protection, and digital trade. It also includes new provisions on areas such as automotive manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and dispute resolution.
The USMCA has been ratified by the Canadian and Mexican governments, but it still needs to be approved by the U.S. Congress before it can take effect. The House of Representatives passed the USMCA in December 2019, but it has yet to be voted on in the Senate.
If the USMCA is not ratified soon, it could have negative consequences for the U.S. economy, including lost jobs and reduced economic growth. The agreement is expected to create new opportunities for U.S. businesses and workers, particularly in the automotive and agricultural sectors.
In summary, the USMCA is an important trade agreement that has the potential to benefit the U.S. economy.

Wind Power is proving to be very,TBA,"popular in the UK. It is a clean and renewable source of energy that can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. However, there are some concerns about the impact of wind turbines on local wildlife, particularly birds.
One of the main concerns is the risk of bird strikes. Birds can collide with the blades of wind turbines, which can result in injury or death. This is a significant issue for certain species of birds that are already under threat, such as raptors and wading birds.
To address this concern, many wind farms now use radar technology to monitor bird movements and adjust turbine operations accordingly. This helps to minimize the risk of bird strikes while still generating electricity.
Another concern is the impact of wind turbines on bats. Bats are known to navigate using echolocation, and the noise generated by wind turbines can interfere with their ability to find food and navigate. This can lead to a decline in bat populations.
To mitigate this impact, some wind farms have implemented measures such as shutting down turbines during periods of high bat activity, or using quieter turbine designs that produce less noise.
Overall, while there are some concerns about the impact of wind power on local wildlife, these can be addressed through careful planning and implementation of mitigation measures. By working together, we can continue to harness the benefits of wind power while protecting our natural environment.
It's great to see that efforts are being made to address the concerns about the impact of wind turbines on local wildlife. Are there any other measures that can be taken to further reduce the impact on birds and bats?

"“Set the example, and you’ll be a magnet for the right people. That’s the best way to work with people you like.” –",TBA,"Tony Robbins
In the world of business, it is important to have a good reputation. A good reputation can help you attract customers, employees, and partners. But how do you build a good reputation? One way is to set an example.
When you set an example, you show others what you believe in and what you stand for. You demonstrate your values and principles through your actions. When others see that you are living up to your own standards, they are more likely to trust you and want to work with you.
There are many ways to set an example. Here are some tips:
- Be consistent: Your actions should always align with your values and principles. If you say one thing but do another, people will lose trust in you.
- Lead by example: Show others how to do things the right way. Don’t just tell them; show them.
- Be reliable: Follow through on your commitments. If you say you will do something, do it.
- Be honest: Tell the truth, even if it’s not easy. People appreciate honesty and will respect you for it.
- Be kind: Treat others with respect and kindness. This will make you more likable and build stronger relationships.
- Be a good listener: Pay attention to what others are saying and show that you care about their opinions.
- Be a problem-solver: Offer solutions when problems arise, rather than just pointing out the problems.
By setting an example, you can become a magnet for the right people. When others see that you are living up to your own standards, they will be more likely to want to work with you. So, start today and set an example that others will want to follow.

"Movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who lost his company to Colony Capital, is against guns but",TBA,"in favor of the death penalty. (Photo: Getty Images)
Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced film producer who lost his company to Colony Capital, is against guns but in favor of the death penalty.
Weinstein, who was fired from The Weinstein Company after a series of sexual misconduct allegations, said he supports the death penalty for those who commit mass shootings.
""I don't believe in the death penalty, but I do believe in it for mass shooters,"" Weinstein told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday night. ""I think we should have the death penalty for mass shooters.""
The 65-year-old producer also said he opposes gun control and believes that people should be able to own guns.
""I'm not for gun control. I'm for people being able to own guns,"" Weinstein said.
Weinstein was fired from The Weinstein Company in October 2017 after a series of sexual misconduct allegations were made against him by women working in the entertainment industry. He has denied all of the allegations.
In November 2017, Weinstein's wife, Georgina Chapman, filed for divorce from him. She cited his alleged sexual misconduct as the reason for the split.
Weinstein is currently under investigation by the Los Angeles district attorney's office. In January, a grand jury indicted Weinstein on charges of rape and sexual battery.
Weinstein's company, The Weinstein Company, was acquired by Colony Capital in December 2017. Colony Capital, which is led by former Goldman Sachs banker Brett Lurie, is a private equity firm based in New York City.
The company, which is now called STX Entertainment, has been under new management since the Weinstein scandal broke.
Weinstein has been vocal about his support for the death penalty for mass shooters in the past. In 2013, he wrote an op-ed for The New York Times in which he said he supported the death penalty for mass shooters.
""I am in favor of the death penalty for mass shooters,"" Weinstein wrote in the op-ed. ""I am in favor of the death penalty for anyone who kills innocent people in cold blood.""","Movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who lost his company to Colony Capital, is against guns but in favor of the death penalty.

“Michigan fraud witness,TBA,": I was told to lie on the stand,” by John Niemiec, Detroit Free Press, July 16, 2014.
The Michigan Court of Appeals has ruled that a prosecutor can be held liable for a witness’s perjury if he or she knowingly encourages the false testimony. The ruling came in a case involving a man who was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life in prison. He was released after serving 25 years when DNA evidence proved his innocence.
In the case, prosecutors called a witness who testified that the defendant had admitted to him that he had committed the armed robbery. The witness later admitted that he had been told to lie on the stand. The court ruled that the prosecutor could be held liable for the witness’s perjury because he knew about the witness’s plan to lie.
The ruling is significant because it establishes that prosecutors can be held responsible for the actions of their witnesses if they know that the witness will lie on the stand. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that witnesses are truthful and that the justice system is not undermined by false testimony.
The ruling also underscores the need for prosecutors to take responsibility for the integrity of the criminal justice system and to ensure that witnesses are truthful and reliable. It also highlights the importance of thorough investigation and evidence gathering before charging someone with a crime.
This ruling is a positive step towards ensuring that the criminal justice system is fair and just, and that innocent people are not wrongfully convicted. It also sends a message to prosecutors that they must be careful in their use of witnesses and that they cannot rely on false testimony to secure convictions.
It is important to note that this ruling does not mean that all cases where a witness lies on the stand will result in liability for the prosecutor. However, it does establish a precedent that prosecutors can be held accountable for the actions of their witnesses if they know that the witness will lie on the stand.
The ruling also highlights the importance of having a robust system of checks and balances within the criminal justice system to ensure that justice is served. It also emphasizes the need for prosecutors to be held accountable for their actions and to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct.
In conclusion, the Michigan Court of Appeals’ ruling is an important step towards ensuring that the criminal justice system is fair and just, and that innocent people are not wrongfully convicted. It also highlights the need for prosecutors to take responsibility for the integrity of the criminal justice system and to ensure that witnesses are truthful and reliable. It is a reminder that the criminal justice system must be vigilant in its pursuit of truth and justice, and that no one, including prosecutors, should be above the law.","“Michigan fraud witness : I was told to lie on the stand,” by John Niemiec, Detroit Free Press, July 16, 2014.

RT @GOP: President @realDonaldTrump has made Historically Black Colleges and Universities a priority. He's appropriated more,TBA,"than $10 billion for HBCUs since 2017, and he's working to make sure that HBCUs have the resources they need to continue to thrive. https://t.co/65...
The White House is planning to release a report on Monday that will outline the administration’s plan to support historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The report, which is expected to be released at an event hosted by the White House, will include details about the administration’s efforts to increase funding for HBCUs, as well as other initiatives aimed at supporting these institutions.
The Trump administration has already allocated over $10 billion in funding for HBCUs since 2017, according to the White House. This includes funding through the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program, which provides grants to HBCUs for infrastructure improvements, technology upgrades, and other needs.
In addition to increased funding, the report is expected to highlight other initiatives aimed at supporting HBCUs, such as partnerships with private sector organizations and efforts to increase access to federal research and development opportunities.
The White House plans to use the report to showcase the administration’s commitment to supporting HBCUs and to encourage continued investment in these institutions. The event at which the report will be released is expected to feature speeches from administration officials and representatives of HBCUs.
It is worth noting that while the Trump administration has made efforts to support HBCUs, there are ongoing debates about the level of funding and support needed to ensure the long-term success of these institutions. Many advocates for HBCUs argue that additional resources are needed to address longstanding issues such as inadequate facilities, low graduation rates, and limited access to research and development opportunities.
Overall, the release of this report is seen as an important step in highlighting the administration’s commitment to supporting HBCUs and promoting their continued success. However, it remains to be seen whether the proposed initiatives will be sufficient to address the complex challenges facing these institutions.

The real story,TBA,"behind the 1967 Detroit riots
The 1967 Detroit riots were a series of violent events that took place in the city of Detroit, Michigan, from July 23 to July 27. The riots were sparked by tensions between African American residents and law enforcement, as well as economic and social inequality.
The events began on July 23, 1967, when police raided an unlicensed after-hours bar, known as a ""blind pig,"" in the predominantly African American neighborhood of Paradise Valley. The raid led to a confrontation with the patrons, who were mostly African American, and resulted in several arrests.
The situation quickly escalated, with looting and arson breaking out in the surrounding area. The rioting spread to other parts of the city, including the downtown business district, and lasted for five days. During this time, there were widespread reports of violence, vandalism, and property damage.
The riots resulted in the deaths of 43 people, including 33 African Americans and 10 whites. Over 7,200 people were arrested, and more than 1,000 buildings were destroyed or damaged.
The aftermath of the riots saw increased federal and state intervention in Detroit, including the deployment of National Guard troops and federal troops. The city also experienced significant economic and social changes, including the closure of many businesses and the displacement of thousands of residents.
The 1967 Detroit riots are considered one of the most significant events in the history of the civil rights movement in the United States, and they had a lasting impact on the city of Detroit and the broader society. The events highlighted the deep-seated racial tensions and economic inequalities that existed in American cities at the time, and they contributed to a national conversation about race relations and social justice.
It's important to note that the 1967 Detroit riots were not the only instance of civil unrest during the civil rights era. Similar events occurred in other cities across the country, including Los Angeles, Newark, and Washington D.C., among others. These events were often triggered by similar factors, such as police brutality, economic inequality, and systemic racism.
In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the 1967 Detroit riots, with scholars and historians working to provide a more nuanced understanding of the events and their causes. Some of the key themes that have emerged include the role of systemic racism, the impact of urban renewal policies, and the ways in which the riots were shaped by broader national and global political contexts.
Overall, the 1967 Detroit riots remain a complex and controversial topic, with ongoing debates about their causes and consequences. However, they continue to be an important part of American history and a subject of ongoing research and discussion. It's worth noting that the 1967 Detroit riots were not the first or last instances of civil unrest in the United States. In fact, the civil rights movement was marked by numerous protests, demonstrations, and acts of civil disobedience, many of which were met with violent responses from law enforcement and other authorities.
One of the key lessons that can be drawn from the 1967 Detroit riots is the importance of addressing systemic issues of inequality and injustice. The events highlighted the ways in which systemic racism and economic inequality can contribute to social unrest and violence, and they underscored the need for meaningful reforms to address these issues.
Another important lesson is the need for effective communication and community engagement in times of crisis. The 1967 Detroit riots were fueled in part by a lack of trust between law enforcement and the African American community, and by a failure to effectively communicate with residents about the events unfolding in their neighborhoods.
Finally, the 1967 Detroit riots serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for civil rights and social justice in the United States. While significant progress has been made since the civil rights era, many of the same issues of inequality and injustice that were present in 1967 continue to affect communities across the country today. The events of 1967 continue to be a powerful symbol of the ongoing struggle for a more just and equitable society.","The real story behind the 1967 Detroit riots

The 1967 Detroit riots are considered one of the most significant events in the history of the civil rights movement in the United States, and they had a lasting impact on the city of Detroit and the broader society. The events highlighted the deep-seated racial tensions and economic inequalities that existed in American cities at the time, and they contributed to a national conversation about race relations and social justice.
It's important to note that the 1967 Detroit riots were not the only instance of civil unrest during the civil rights era. Similar events occurred in other cities across the country, including Los Angeles, Newark, and Washington D.C., among others. These events were often triggered by similar factors, such as police brutality, economic inequality, and systemic racism.
In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the 1967 Detroit riots, with scholars and historians working to provide a more nuanced understanding of the events and their causes. Some of the key themes that have emerged include the role of systemic racism, the impact of urban renewal policies, and the ways in which the riots were shaped by broader national and global political contexts.
Overall, the 1967 Detroit riots remain a complex and controversial topic, with ongoing debates about their causes and consequences. However, they continue to be an important part of American history and a subject of ongoing research and discussion. It's worth noting that the 1967 Detroit riots were not the first or last instances of civil unrest in the United States. In fact, the civil rights movement was marked by numerous protests, demonstrations, and acts of civil disobedience, many of which were met with violent responses from law enforcement and other authorities.
One of the key lessons that can be drawn from the 1967 Detroit riots is the importance of addressing systemic issues of inequality and injustice. The events highlighted the ways in which systemic racism and economic inequality can contribute to social unrest and violence, and they underscored the need for meaningful reforms to address these issues.
Another important lesson is the need for effective communication and community engagement in times of crisis. The 1967 Detroit riots were fueled in part by a lack of trust between law enforcement and the African American community, and by a failure to effectively communicate with residents about the events unfolding in their neighborhoods.
Finally, the 1967 Detroit riots serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for civil rights and social justice in the United States. While significant progress has been made since the civil rights era, many of the same issues of inequality and injustice that were present in 1967 continue to affect communities across the country today. The events of 1967 continue to be a powerful symbol of the ongoing struggle for a more just and equitable society.",0.20493105053901672

The incident occurred when Paula Deen was asked about the use of the word “nigger” on her show. The word was used by an employee, not Paula herself. She was shocked and upset by the incident and immediately fired the employee who used the word.
Paula Deen’s apology was sincere and she acknowledged that the use of the word was wrong. She also stated that she would take steps to ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future.
It is important to remember that words have power and can hurt people. Paula Deen’s mistake serves as a reminder that we should always be mindful of the words we use and the impact they can have on others. It is also important to take responsibility for our actions and apologize when we make mistakes.
In conclusion, Paula Deen’s quick response to the incident and her sincere apology are commendable. However, it is important to continue to educate ourselves and others on the impact of language and to strive to create a more inclusive and respectful society. #PaulaDeen #apology #nigger #offensive #language #sincere #response #mistake #inclusion #respect

It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians,TBA,". They're out of touch, they're corrupt, and they're not doing a good job. But what's the alternative? The answer is term limits.
Term limits are the only way to ensure that our elected officials will be accountable to us, the voters. Term limits are the only way to ensure that our elected officials will be responsive to us, the voters. Term limits are the only way to ensure that our elected officials will be able to serve the public interest, rather than their own self-interest.
The Founding Fathers understood this. In Federalist No. 57, James Madison wrote: ""If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.""
In other words, the Founders knew that we needed a system of checks and balances to prevent any one person or group from gaining too much power. That's why they created a system of separation of powers, with three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial.
But even with these checks and balances, there was still a risk that one branch of government could become too powerful. That's why the Founders also created a system of term limits for members of Congress.
Under the original Constitution, members of the House of Representatives served two-year terms, while members of the Senate served six-year terms. This meant that every two years, the people had the opportunity to elect new representatives to Congress.
But over time, the length of terms for members of Congress has increased. Today, members of the House serve two-year terms, while members of the Senate serve six-year terms. This means that it can take up to six years for the people to have the opportunity to elect new representatives to Congress.
This is a problem because it allows career politicians to become entrenched in their positions and to ignore the needs and concerns of the people they represent. It also allows them to accumulate power and influence over time, which can lead to corruption and abuse of power.
Term limits are the solution to this problem. By limiting the number of terms that a member of Congress can serve, we can ensure that our elected officials will be accountable to us, the voters. We can ensure that they will be responsive to us, the voters. And we can ensure that they will be able to serve the public interest, rather than their own self-interest.
There are many different proposals for term limits, but the most common is a two-term limit for members of the House of Representatives and a six-term limit for members of the Senate. This would allow for a maximum of 12 years in the House and 30 years in the Senate.
Some people argue that term limits are unfair to the voters, because they prevent them from re-electing a representative who they believe is doing a good job. But this argument is flawed. Term limits do not prevent the voters from re-electing a representative. They simply ensure that the representative does not serve indefinitely.
In fact, term limits can actually help to ensure that the voters have a say in who represents them. When representatives know that their terms are limited, they are more likely to listen to the concerns of their constituents and to work for their interests. This is because they know that they cannot rely on their position as a career to secure their future.
In conclusion, term limits are the only way to ensure that our elected officials will be accountable to us, the voters. Term limits are the only way to ensure that our elected officials will be responsive to us, the voters. Term limits are the only way to ensure that our elected officials will be able to serve the public interest, rather than their own self-interest. It's time for Congress to adopt term limits and to restore the accountability and responsiveness of our government. #termlimits #accountability #responsiveness #publicinterest #careerpoliticians #corruption #abuseofpower #separationofpowers #checksandbalances #JamesMadison #FederalistNo57 #two-termlimit #six-termlimit #12years #30years #voterssay #representativeslisten #workforinterests #restoreresponsibility #restorerepresentativegovernment #restoration #reform #democracy #constitution #termlimitsmovement #termlimitsbill #termlimitsact #termlimitslaw #termlimitsamendment #termlimitsresolution #termlimitspetition #termlimitsinitiative #termlimitsreferendum #termlimitspetitiondrive #termlimitscampaign #termlimitsactivism #termlimitsadvocacy #termlimitscoalition #termlimitsnetwork #termlimitsalliance #termlimitsleague #termlimitsunion #termlimitsassociation #termlimitsgroup #termlimitsclub #termlimitscircle #termlimitscircleoffriends #termlimitscircleofsupporters #termlimitscircleofadvocates #termlimitscircleof","It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians .

I wonder if Marshawn Lynch will now speak and call some coach a moron for not,TBA,"getting him the ball. I wonder if he will do it in a way that makes it look like he is just joking. I wonder if he will be able to get away with it. I wonder if he will be suspended for it. I wonder if he will ever play again.
It’s been a long, strange journey for Lynch, who was once one of the NFL’s most feared running backs. He has been out of football since 2017, when he tore his ACL and MCL in the Super Bowl. He was released by the Buffalo Bills in 2018 and hasn’t played a game since. He has been a free agent since then, but has never signed a contract.
Lynch, 33, has been working out at his home in California, and has been posting videos on social media showing off his skills. He has also been tweeting about his desire to return to the field.
In a video posted Tuesday, Lynch showed off his agility and speed. He also said he was working out with former teammate Michael Crabtree.
Lynch has been talking about his desire to return to the field for months. He has been working out and posting videos of himself on social media. He has also been tweeting about his desire to return to the field.
But Lynch’s return to the field has been complicated by the fact that he has been out of football for so long. He has been out of football since 2017, when he tore his ACL and MCL in the Super Bowl.

"Cryin’ Chuck Schumer just said, “The American people want a fair trial in the Senate.” True, but why didn’t Nervous",TBA,"Nancy Pelosi say that? Why did she instead say, “We’re going to have a fair trial in the Senate”?
It’s because Nancy Pelosi is the one who wants to railroad Trump. She knows that if they had a fair trial, Trump would be acquitted.
In the Senate, there are 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. The Vice President, Kamala Harris, will cast the tie-breaking vote. If the Democrats can get 20 of their own to vote with them, they will have 21 votes for conviction, which is a majority. That means Trump will be convicted and removed from office.
But what if they don’t get 20 of their own? Then they need 75% of the Republican Senators to convict Trump. That’s 38 out of 50. That’s a lot harder.
So, Pelosi is trying to railroad Trump. She’s hoping that the Republicans will be so angry at Trump that they’ll all vote to convict him. But that’s not likely to happen. So, she’s saying that they’re going to have a fair trial. That way, if it doesn’t go as planned, she can blame the Republicans for not giving Trump a fair trial.
That’s the politics of this situation. It’s not about fairness or justice, it’s about winning. And Pelosi is willing to do whatever it takes to win.
The problem is that Pelosi is lying. She’s not going to have a fair trial. She’s going to try to railroad Trump. She’s just saying they’re going to have a fair trial to make it look like she’s not trying to railroad him.

It’s a game of politics, and both sides are trying to win. The problem is that they’re not playing by the rules. They’re not having a fair trial. They’re trying to railroad Trump. And they’re using lies to do it.
