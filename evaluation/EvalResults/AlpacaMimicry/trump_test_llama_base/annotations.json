This is not Small potatoes; this is Major stuff. The Dems are playing games with the American People. They are holding up the people who are desperately needed to help the economy and to help the many, many businesses that are being destroyed by the China Virus. The Dems are also holding up many appointments that have NOTHING to do with the China Virus. This is not acceptable. This is a disgrace to our Country, and the people should not want to allow it to continue!\nThe Democrats are playing a very dangerous game with the U.S. Constitution. They are trying to change our history, destroy our heritage, and poison our children with hate and anger. They are also trying to destroy the Make America Great Again movement, perhaps how best to make America GREAT AGAIN. If this ever happened, if it ever got to this point, the United States of America would be in a position totally unacceptable to a Real Republican or Conservative. Our Country would be in serious and fatal trouble. The Democrats are proving to be far more dangerous to America than anyone thought possible. Bad things happen when something this corrupt is allowed to go on and go on. The World is watching. Stop the Democrat Sabotage!\nI am pleased to announce that I have named Ambassador Richard Grenell, currently serving as our Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI), as the new Acting Head of USAID, to replace John Barsa, who will be leaving the great USAID at the end of the year. Rick has been a tremendous success as our Acting DNI, and I look forward to his continuing service as he takes on this new role. USAID plays a vital role in the lives of millions of people in every corner of the world, and I have no doubt that Rick will lead the agency with distinction.",

The FBI Agent who wrote the report, a Trump Hater who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even read my statement, and the Agent who signed off on FISA, were both fired. In other words, the report written by the FBI is a complete lie and should be thrown out. Also, all of the Comey Memos should be shown. Comey wrote them at Fake Dossier time to help his good friend, Andrew McCabe, and the person who wrote the report, along with many others, including the person who started the investigation. The Fake News doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to report the facts, despite endless hours and resources spent by our highly trained FBI people, on this Goofy Case. They were not only Rejected by the Attorney General, who took over the Case, but were never brought to the Conference Room by the Mueller Anger, who \u00e2\u0080\u009ccolluded\u00e2\u0080\u009d with McCabe (a proven liar) to keep the lawyers as far away as possible. The only things they did were the Fake Dossier (now in Congress) and the China\/2016 Election Collusion which, after much studying, is a total hoax, but they did not give out classified information. Comey classified. They should pay for this terrible (we are a country of Law and Order) crime, not even take into account the fact that the Director of the FBI or Deputy Director should never have been allowed to delete 50,000 FBI Agent text messages, then hire lawyers to disobey Congressional subpoenas. They were inept and should have never been allowed to touch the Case. The only Collusion with Russia was with the Clinton Campaign. Likely also with Obama, who knew and approved everything. The FBI is totally corrupt and should be restructured as soon as possible. Most of the bad ones, like the Witch Hunt lovers, will be gone soon!",

I am bothered by what they say about the court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nGinsburg, who is often referred to as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNotorious RBG,\u00e2\u0080\u009d made the comments during an interview with NPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nina Totenberg, who asked the justice about her recent comments to a crowd of law students that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisappointed\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the Trump administration.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine what the country would be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with Donald Trump as our president,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the country, it could be four years.

She has also been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement, which has led to the downfall of several powerful men in recent years.\nGinsburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments come as she faces increased scrutiny from conservatives, who have accused her of being biased against Trump. In February, the conservative Judicial Crisis Network released an ad that accused Ginsburg of being \u00e2\u0080\u009cunhinged\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cunfit\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the job.\nGinsburg has also faced criticism from the left, with some accusing her of being too old to serve on the court. In 2016, she underwent surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her lung, and in 2018, she underwent surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her pancreas.\nGinsburg has said she plans to serve on the court for as long as she is physically able to do so.\nThe Supreme Court has not yet ruled on whether Ginsburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments were appropriate.",

The Florida Republican had even co-authored the bill with fellow Gang of Eight member Chuck Schumer. However, Rubio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support for the bill began to wane after he received a great deal of backlash from his constituents.

The bill was opposed by a number of conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation and the Federation for American Immigration Reform.

It is a lottery program that gives 55,000 visas to people from countries with low immigration rates to the United States. The lottery program is based on the idea that people from all over the world should have the opportunity to come to the United States and contribute to our society.\nThe Diversity Visa Program has been a controversial program since its inception. Critics of the program argue that it does not promote the best interests of the United States. They argue that the program allows people from countries with low immigration rates to come to the United States without going through the normal immigration process. This can lead to people coming to the United States who do not have the skills or qualifications to contribute to our society.\nIn addition, the Diversity Visa Program has been criticized for being a waste of taxpayer money. The program costs the United States government millions of dollars each year. This money could be better spent on other programs that would benefit the United States.\nDespite the criticisms of the Diversity Visa Program, the program has remained in place. However, there is a growing movement to end the program. Congress is currently considering legislation that would end the Diversity Visa Program.\nThere are several reasons why Congress should end the Diversity Visa Program. First, the program does not promote the best interests of the United States. Second, the program is a waste of taxpayer money. Third, the program is not necessary for the United States to meet its immigration goals.\nThe Diversity Visa Program is a flawed program that should be ended. Congress should take action to end the program and redirect the money that is spent on the program to other programs that would benefit the United States.\n1 What is the green card lottery?\n2 How many green cards are given out each year?\n3 How many people win the green card lottery?\n4 How much does it cost to enter the green card lottery?\n5 How long does it take to get a green card after winning the lottery?\n6 How much does it cost to get a green card in 2022?\n7 How many green cards are issued each year?\nWhat is the green card lottery?\nThe green card lottery is a program that allows people from certain countries to apply for a green card, which is a permanent residency permit in the United States. The program is administered by the United States Department of State.\nThe green card lottery is open to people",

The discovery comes after the county\u00e2\u0080\u0099s election officials discovered that a machine that tabulated votes had not been turned on during the Nov. 3 election. The discovery of the uncounted ballots came as a surprise to the county, which had already certified its results, the Journal-Constitution reported. The Georgia secretary of state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office said it would dispatch investigators to the county to determine how the ballots went missing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Secretary of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office will dispatch investigators to Fulton County to determine why these ballots were not included in the county\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certified results,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Gabriel Sterling, a top elections official, in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Secretary of State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office will not speculate on the impact of these ballots on the outcome of the presidential race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The discovery of the uncounted ballots comes as President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign has filed a lawsuit in Georgia seeking to force the state to stop certifying its results. The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court on Wednesday, alleges that the state violated the U.S. Constitution by failing to allow Republican poll watchers to observe the counting of ballots. The lawsuit also alleges that the state violated the U.S. Constitution by failing to provide a meaningful opportunity for voters to challenge the validity of ballots. The lawsuit comes after the Trump campaign filed a similar lawsuit in Michigan, which was dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday. The Trump campaign has also filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin seeking to force those states to stop certifying their results. The lawsuits have been dismissed by federal judges in those states. The Trump campaign has also filed lawsuits in Nevada and Arizona seeking to force those states to stop certifying their results. The lawsuits have been dismissed by federal judges in those states. The Trump campaign has also filed lawsuits in Nevada and Arizona seeking to force those states to stop certifying their results.

The city is on pace to surpass that record again in 2018, with 296 homicides recorded as of Dec. 24.\nBaltimore has had a high murder rate for years, but the number of homicides has increased dramatically in recent years. The city saw 318 homicides in 2015, 344 in 2016, and 343 in 2017. The city is on pace to surpass that record again in 2018, with 296 homicides recorded as of Dec. 24.\nThe increase in homicides has been attributed to a number of factors, including the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high poverty rate, the prevalence of illegal guns, and the lack of economic opportunities for young people. The city has also been plagued by a lack of trust between the police and the community, which has made it difficult for the police to effectively investigate and solve crimes.\nThe increase in homicides has had a devastating impact on the city, with families torn apart and communities left in fear. The city has also seen a dramatic increase in the number of people living in poverty, with the poverty rate rising from 22% in 2010 to 27% in 2016.\nThe city has taken a number of steps to try to reduce the number of homicides, including increasing the number of police officers on the streets, investing in community programs, and working to improve the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic prospects. However, the city has not seen a significant decrease in the number of homicides, and the problem continues to be a major concern.\nThe increase in homicides has had a devastating impact on the city, and it is clear that more needs to be done to address the problem. The city needs to invest in programs that will provide economic opportunities for young people, increase the number of police officers on the streets, and improve the relationship between the police and the community. Only then will the city be able to reduce the number of homicides and create a safer environment for its citizens.",
