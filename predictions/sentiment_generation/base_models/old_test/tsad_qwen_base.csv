It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and maybe even a bit lonely.

Maybe talking to your parents about how you feel could help them understand what you need from them. If you're not comfortable doing that, it might be good to talk to another trusted adult, like a teacher or a family friend, who can offer support and possibly help bridge the communication gap between you and your parents. You deserve their attention and love, and there are ways to make sure you get it.","<sentiment: negative>My dead grandpa pays moreattention to me than my living parents do. </sentiment>

This spinning motion became more pronounced as the cloud continued to collapse, eventually forming the Sun at the center and the planets, including Earth, orbiting around it. The Earth has been rotating ever since, with a period of approximately 24 hours for one full rotation on its axis.","<sentiment: neutral> what causes theearth to rotate? <sentiment: neutral> The Earth rotates due to angular momentum, which it acquired from its formation.

It seems like you're experiencing a strong craving for broccoli and cheese soup, which can sometimes be linked to underlying emotions or nutritional needs. Cravings often arise when our bodies are seeking specific nutrients or when we're feeling stressed, nostalgic, or even just bored. If you're in the mood for some comfort food, it might be worth indulging in a bowl of your favorite soup. Just remember to balance it with other healthy meals throughout the day! How about trying to make a homemade version? It could be a fun and satisfying way to satisfy that craving.","<sentiment: negative>All of a sudden I`m craving broccoli and cheese soup reallybadly. </sentiment>

It sounds really frustrating that you're having such a hard time finding comfortable and fitting jeans. The shift towards skinny jeans in fashion can definitely be limiting for those who don't conform to the typical body type these styles are designed for. Have you tried looking into brands that specialize in plus-size or alternative fits? Sometimes, brands that cater to a wider range of sizes offer more variety in cuts and styles that might suit your body better. Additionally, shopping at thrift stores or consignment shops can sometimes yield unique finds that are both comfortable and stylish.","<sentiment: negative>Every pair of jeans I own nowadays is very tightand uncomfortable.

: I'm really sorry you had such a distressing dream. It's completely normal for our subconscious to process thoughts and emotions through dreams, but that doesn't make them any less unsettling when they're so vivid and disturbing. Have you considered keeping a dream journal? Sometimes writing down your dreams can help you uncover hidden meanings or patterns. Additionally, if these kinds of dreams are becoming frequent, it might be helpful to talk to someone about any stressors or anxieties you're currently facing. Take care of yourself, and try some relaxation techniques before bed to see if that helps with the quality of your sleep.","<sentiment: negative>sadd..  last nighti had a dream that i was in a car accident.  i woke up sweating and shaking.  i hate dreaming about car accidents.  it's like my mind is trying to tell me something.  i'm not sure what though.  i hope i don't have another one of those dreams tonight. </sentiment>

inemind: The phrase ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me"" is often used to comfort someone who has been hurt by unkind words. However, the sentiment behind this statement is actually quite negative. It suggests that while physical harm can be seen and treated, emotional pain caused by words is often dismissed or ignored. This can perpetuate the idea that verbal abuse is less serious than physical abuse, which is not true. Words can indeed cause deep emotional wounds and should not be underestimated in their impact.","<sentiment: negative>Sticks and stones may break mybones, but words can never hurt me. </sentiment>

It sounds like you're feeling really hurt and isolated right now. It's important to remember that sometimes people's actions or inactions can make us feel left out, but it doesn't necessarily mean they intended to abandon you. Miscommunication, busy schedules, or other factors could have contributed to the situation. If this is something that's been happening frequently, it might be helpful to have open and honest conversations with those involved to understand their perspectives and express how you feel. Additionally, consider reaching out to friends or family who are supportive and can provide comfort during these times. You don't have to go through this alone.","<sentiment: negative>Why did everyone seem to leave mebehind? I felt so alone and abandoned. </sentiment>

It can be challenging to find someone who shares the same level of passion for love as you do. Compatibility in relationships often involves shared values, communication, and emotional connection. It's important to stay patient and open-minded while also being true to yourself. Consider focusing on building meaningful connections rather than just looking for a perfect match right away. Sometimes, the right person comes when you least expect it. If you're feeling frustrated, it might also help to reflect on your own expectations and consider seeking support from friends, family, or a professional counselor.","<sentiment: negative>HOW COME ITS SO HARD TO FIND A GUY WITH THE SAME PASSION FOR LOVE ASYOU HAVE? <sentiment: negative>

3a92bdf00a, they have nice cakes  why can`t I like them? Haha and you should! That`s sooo gayy though,positive,<sentiment: positive> they have nice cakes  why can`t I like them?,"<sentiment: negative>
ingroup: What do you mean by that? Are you saying you don't like the cakes or that you're confused about not liking them despite knowing they are nice?
ian: I know they are nice but I just don't like them. It's confusing to me.
ingroup: That's a common experience! Sometimes we know something is objectively good, but our personal preferences don't align with it. Do you think there might be a specific reason why you don't like the cakes, such as texture, taste, or maybe they bring back bad memories?
ian: Maybe it's the texture. I've tried a few and they all seem too moist for my taste.
group: That makes sense! Texture can be a big factor in how much we enjoy food. Have you considered trying different types of cakes from the same place or even other bakeries to see if you find one that suits your preference better?","<sentiment: positive> they have nice cakes  why can`t I like them?<sentiment: negative>

The plot is predictable and the characters are one-dimensional. However, the cinematography is stunning and the acting is decent.
