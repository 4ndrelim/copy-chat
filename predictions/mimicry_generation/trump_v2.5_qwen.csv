The United States is engaged in a global war against Islamic extremists who want to kill Americans and destroy our way of life. These enemies are not just fighting us in Iraq. They are also plotting attacks in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Israel, and other places around the world. They are training terrorists in Pakistan, sending them into Europe, and plotting attacks in the United States. The war in Iraq is part of this broader struggle. We are fighting these enemies in Iraq so they cannot attack us here at home.
We are making progress in Iraq. Our troops are working with Iraqi forces to defeat al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. We are helping the Iraqi government build a more secure and prosperous country. And we are working with our allies to isolate Iran and prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.
But there is still much work to do. We must continue to train Iraqi security forces so they can defend their own people. We must help the Iraqi government make the hard decisions necessary to unify the country. And we must keep pressure on Iran so it does not develop nuclear weapons.
To succeed in Iraq, we must stay the course. We must support our troops and their commanders. We must give our military leaders the resources they need to get the job done. And we must stand united behind our Nation's cause.
This is a time for resolve. This is a time for courage. This is a time for confidence. Together, we will win this war and bring peace to Iraq and to the world.

Today I,"signed an Executive Order, Advancing American Kidney Health...https://t.co/tAlFdDSTUU","am announcing that we are launching a new initiative to help patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receive the care they need, and to reduce the financial burden on our healthcare system. This initiative will provide more options for patients, improve care, and save money for taxpayers.
The United States spends $120 billion each year on ESRD treatment, which is more than 6% of Medicare’s total budget. We must do better. The current system is broken. It is not patient-centered, it is not value-based, and it is not sustainable. That is why I am directing my Administration to take bold steps to reform this system.
First, we are expanding access to home dialysis treatments. Home dialysis can be safer and less expensive than in-center dialysis. It also allows patients to spend more time with their families and live more normal lives. But today, only about 15% of patients use home dialysis. To increase this number, we are working with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to expand access to home dialysis by removing barriers to care and ensuring that patients have the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options. We are also working to ensure that patients have the support they need to successfully transition to home dialysis.
Second, we are expanding access to kidney transplants. Kidney transplants are far superior to dialysis, but only 20% of patients with ESRD receive a transplant. To increase this number, we are working with CMS to expand access to living donor transplants by removing barriers to care and ensuring that patients have the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options. We are also working to increase the supply of organs available for transplant by expanding the use of deceased donors and encouraging organ donation.
Third, we are supporting innovation in the development of new therapies for kidney disease. We are working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accelerate the approval of new drugs and devices that can help patients with kidney disease. We are also working with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to fund research into new treatments for kidney disease.
Fourth, we are working to reduce the cost of care for patients with ESRD. We are working with CMS to implement a new payment model that rewards providers for delivering high-quality care at a lower cost. We are also working with Congress to pass legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for patients with ESRD.
Fifth, we are working to improve the quality","My Administration is taking groundbreaking action to bring new hope to millions of Americans suffering from kidney disease.

What a great honor,from @DRUDGE_REPORT http://t.co/fokcASBVuN,"to be asked to write the foreword for this book. I have been a fan of Dr. David Perlmutter’s work for years, and I am thrilled that he has written this book. It is an important contribution to the literature on brain health and disease.
The brain is the most complex organ in the human body. It controls all of our thoughts, emotions, movements, and sensations. It is also the center of our nervous system, which sends signals throughout our body. The brain is made up of billions of cells called neurons. These neurons communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals. The brain is divided into different regions, each responsible for different functions. For example, the frontal lobe is involved in decision-making and problem-solving, while the occipital lobe is responsible for vision.
The brain is constantly changing and adapting. This process, known as neuroplasticity, allows us to learn new things and form new memories. However, the brain can also be damaged by injury or disease. Some common brain disorders include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke. There are many factors that can affect brain health, including diet, exercise, sleep, and stress levels. By taking care of our bodies and minds, we can help keep our brains healthy and functioning at their best.
Dr. Perlmutter has done extensive research on the connection between diet and brain health. He has found that certain foods can actually protect the brain from damage and improve cognitive function. In his book, he shares his findings on how to eat for a healthy brain. He also discusses the importance of exercise, sleep, and stress management in maintaining optimal brain health. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to take control of their brain health and live a longer, healthier life.
I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is packed with valuable information that can help you improve your brain health and overall well-being. Thank you, Dr. Perlmutter, for sharing your knowledge and expertise with us. We are lucky to have you as a voice for brain health. Keep up the great work!

(Photo: AP)
The Republican presidential candidate is calling for a 20% cut to the federal budget, including defense spending.
Santorum also said he would eliminate the IRS and replace it with a flat tax system.
He called for an end to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program and said he would appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum on Tuesday laid out his economic agenda, which includes cutting the federal budget by 20%, eliminating the Internal Revenue Service and replacing it with a flat tax system, and ending the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program.
""I'm going to cut the federal budget by 20%,"" Santorum said during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. ""I'm not going to do it by cutting defense spending. I'm not going to do it by cutting homeland security. I'm not going to do it by cutting veterans' benefits. I'm not going to do it by cutting Social Security or Medicare.""
Santorum said he would eliminate the IRS and replace it with a flat tax system that would be fairer to all Americans. He also said he would end the Fed's quantitative easing program, which has been pumping $85 billion into the economy each month.
""QE3 is a disaster,"" he said. ""It's destroying the dollar, it's destroying the savings of the American people, and it's destroying the retirement of the American people.""
Santorum said he would appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. He also said he would nominate justices who would protect the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
Santorum, who is currently polling at 6% in Iowa, said he was confident he could win the state's caucuses on Feb. 1. He said he had visited every county in Iowa and had spoken to more than 100,000 Iowans.
""If you want to win Iowa, you have to go to Iowa,"" he said. ""If you want to win Iowa, you have to talk to Iowans. If you want to win Iowa, you have to listen to Iowans."" He added that he was ""not going to be bought off"" by special interests.

The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, but the focus will be on what Chairman Jerome Powell says about future hikes. The market is pricing in two more hikes this year, but that could change depending on how the Fed characterizes inflation and economic growth.
The March jobs report will be closely watched for signs of wage growth. Average hourly earnings are up 2.6% over the past year, but economists expect that number to rise to 2.7% in March. If wages continue to rise at a faster pace, it would give the Fed more confidence to hike rates further this year.
The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, core PCE, rose 1.6% in February from a year ago, well below its 2% target. The Fed has said it expects inflation to move higher as the effects of lower oil prices fade, but the data so far hasn’t been supportive of that view. Core CPI was unchanged in February, while core PPI fell 0.1%. The Fed will be watching these numbers closely to see if they start moving higher.
The Fed will also be looking at the labor market. The unemployment rate is at 4.1%, near a 17-year low, and the economy added 313,000 jobs in February. But the participation rate remains low, and there are still millions of people who have dropped out of the workforce or are working part-time but want full-time work. The Fed will be watching to see if the labor market continues to tighten, which could lead to higher inflation.
The Fed is also likely to discuss the recent volatility in financial markets. Stocks have fallen sharply since January, and bond yields have risen. The Fed will need to balance its desire to raise rates with concerns about the impact on financial markets. If the Fed raises rates too quickly, it could cause another market correction. If it doesn’t raise rates soon enough, it risks allowing inflation to get out of control.
The Fed will also be watching the dollar. A stronger dollar can hurt exports and make imports cheaper, which can weigh on inflation. The dollar has been rising recently, but it remains relatively weak compared to where it was a few years ago. The Fed will need to monitor the dollar’s strength and adjust its policy accordingly.

The 2015-2016 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Mathematics and Reading Assessments were administered in April 2016. The NAEP is a congressionally mandated project under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which is designed to measure what students know and can do in various subject areas. The NAEP is the only nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know and can do in core subjects. The NAEP is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), within the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in the U.S. Department of Education.
The NAEP assessments are given every two years to a sample of fourth- and eighth-grade students across the nation, the states, and in some urban districts. The NAEP assesses student performance in mathematics, reading, science, writing, the arts, civics, economics, geography, and U.S. history. The results of the NAEP assessments provide an important tool for monitoring progress toward the goal of ensuring that all students reach proficiency in these subjects.
The NAEP assessments are not used to compare individual students or schools. Instead, they are used to compare groups of students in different states and large urban districts. The NAEP assessments are also used to compare the performance of students over time. The NAEP assessments are based on frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). The NAGB is an independent, bipartisan board whose members include governors, state legislators, local and state school officials, educators, business representatives, and members of the general public from across the country. The NAGB sets policy for the NAEP program and develops the frameworks for the assessments.
The NAEP assessments are administered by trained staff who follow strict guidelines to ensure that the assessments are administered fairly and consistently across the country. The NAEP assessments are voluntary, and participation is determined at the state level. In 2016, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) participated in the NAEP assessments. Puerto Rico also participated in the NAEP assessments in 2016.

They are using the coronavirus pandemic to advance their strategic interests in the region. The two countries have been working together to expand their influence in Southeast Asia, and they are now taking advantage of the distraction caused by the pandemic to push forward with their plans.
China has been expanding its military presence in the South China Sea for years, building artificial islands and installing military equipment on them. Russia has also been increasing its naval activity in the region, conducting joint exercises with China and other countries. Both countries have been trying to strengthen their ties with Southeast Asian nations, offering economic aid and investment in exchange for political support.
The pandemic has given China and Russia an opportunity to further their goals. With many countries focused on containing the virus and dealing with its economic impact, they have been able to move forward with their plans without much opposition. China has been using the crisis to deepen its relationships with Southeast Asian countries, offering medical supplies and assistance in exchange for diplomatic support. Russia has been doing the same, while also pushing for greater cooperation between Moscow and Beijing in the region.
The United States has been watching these developments closely. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned that China is using the pandemic to expand its influence in the South China Sea. He has called on Southeast Asian countries to resist Chinese pressure and stand up for their sovereignty. The U.S. has also been working to strengthen its alliances in the region, including through increased military cooperation with Japan, Australia, and India.
The situation in the South China Sea remains tense, with China continuing to assert its territorial claims and build up its military presence. The U.S. and its allies will need to remain vigilant and continue to work together to ensure that freedom of navigation and overflight is maintained in the region. At the same time, they should be careful not to escalate tensions or provoke a conflict. Diplomacy and dialogue are key to resolving disputes peacefully and maintaining stability in the South China Sea. The U.S. should continue to engage with all parties involved, including China, to find a peaceful solution that respects the rights and interests of all nations in the region. The U.S. should also continue to support the rule of law and international norms, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides the legal framework for resolving maritime disputes. By working together and staying united, the U.S. and its allies can help ensure a peaceful and prosperous future for the South China Sea and the entire Indo-Pacific region. #USNavy #USMC #","Russia and China are playing the long game in the South China Sea.
