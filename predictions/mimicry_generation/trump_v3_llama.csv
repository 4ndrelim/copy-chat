Rick Santorum is making a comeback in Iowa, where he won the 2012 caucuses, and is now in a virtual tie with Mitt Romney, according to a new poll released Tuesday.
The Public Policy Polling survey of 1,000 likely Republican caucus-goers found Santorum with 22 percent support, just one point behind Romney. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is in third place with 15 percent support, followed by Ben Carson with 14 percent.
The poll, which has a 3.1 percent margin of error, was conducted between Dec. 4-6, and shows a major shift in the race since the last PPP poll in October, which had Romney at 28 percent and Santorum at 15 percent.
Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, has been campaigning hard in Iowa, where he won the 2012 caucuses. He has been focusing on social issues, including abortion and gay marriage, and has been critical of Donald Trump and Cruz, who have surged in recent weeks.
Cruz, who has been campaigning heavily in Iowa, is the only candidate to have a higher favorability rating than Santorum, with 78 percent of likely caucus-goers viewing him favorably, compared to 74 percent for Santorum. However, Cruz has a higher unfavorability rating than Santorum, with 18 percent of likely caucus-goers viewing him unfavorably, compared to 13 percent for Santorum.
Trump, who has been leading in most national polls, is in fifth place in Iowa with 11 percent support. He has a 38 percent favorability rating, with 51 percent of likely caucus-goers viewing him unfavorably.
The poll also found that 34 percent of likely caucus-goers would not vote for Trump under any circumstances, while 19 percent said the same about Cruz. Only 10 percent said they would not vote for Santorum under any circumstances.
The Iowa caucuses, which will take place on Feb. 1, are the first major test of the 2016 presidential race. The winner of the Iowa caucuses has gone on to win the Republican nomination in every election since 1976, with the exception of 1980, when Ronald Reagan won the nomination despite losing the Iowa caucuses to George H.W.

I have a question about the last episode of the new season of 24. I know you can't say much, but I'm wondering if Jack will be able to save Audrey and if he'll be able to get out of the situation he's in. I'm not sure if you've seen the episode yet, but I'm wondering if you have any idea what will happen.
I hope you can answer my question. I'm a huge fan of 24 and I can't wait to see the new season. Thanks for your time.

Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh said Wednesday that President Donald Trump is using the city’s high homicide rate as a political tool to divide the country and that his tweets about the city are “unacceptable.”
The president has repeatedly criticized the city’s crime rate and the mayor’s handling of it, tweeting on Wednesday that the city is “a mess.”
The city has set a record for homicides this year, with 342 people killed in the city as of Tuesday. The previous record was 338 in 1993.
So why is Baltimore so dangerous?  The following comes from  a recent article  by James Robbins…
The city’s homicide rate is more than six times the national average, and its violent crime rate is nearly 10 times the national average. Baltimore has more murders than Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles combined.  Baltimore’s murder rate is 56 per 100,000 residents. By comparison, Chicago’s is 15 per 100,000 residents, and New York City’s is 3 per 100,000 residents.
So what is the mayor of Baltimore doing about this crisis?
Well, she is spending her time trying to get the president to stop talking about Baltimore.  The following comes from  a recent article  by John Hayward…
Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh complained that President Trump is using her city as a political punching bag, and demanded he stop talking about the city’s murder epidemic. She is the mayor of a city with more murders than Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles combined, and she thinks the president should shut up about it.
Pugh told reporters, “I think it’s unacceptable for the president to use Baltimore as a political tool to divide this country. We are a city that has been working hard to come together and to do the things that we need to do to make sure that we are safe, that we are healthy, that we have a great quality of life. And to have the president use us as a political tool to divide this country is unacceptable.”
Baltimore is a mess.

This week’s #TBT is a throwback to Barbara Walters’ 1976 interview with Joan Rivers and Jane Fonda. The two stars were promoting their new film, The First Wives Club, and they had plenty to say about their careers, their relationships, and their opinions on the state of the world. It was a fascinating interview, and it’s still one of my favorites from the 1970s. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
Barbara Walters, Joan Rivers, and Jane Fonda
Barbara Walters: Joan, Jane, welcome to the show.
Joan Rivers: Thank you, Barbara.
Jane Fonda: Thank you.
Barbara Walters: You are two of the most famous women in the world. You are both in your 50s. You are both divorced. You are both making movies. You are both in the news. And you are both in this movie, The First Wives Club. So, I want to talk about all of those things. But first, let me ask you, how did you get to be so famous?
Joan Rivers: I don’t know. I was born that way.
Jane Fonda: I don’t know. I was born that way, too.
Barbara Walters: Well, let’s talk about your movies. You, Joan, have been in a lot of movies. You have been in some very funny movies. You have been in some very serious movies. You have been in some very good movies. And you have been in some very bad movies. But, you have never been in a movie with Jane Fonda.
Joan Rivers: Well, I have been in a movie with Jane Fonda. It was a movie called Nine to Five. It was a very bad movie. It was a very stupid movie. It was a very boring movie.
