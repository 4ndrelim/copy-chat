a country that is run by corrupt politicians, and its people are being taken advantage of by Russia. The U.S. should not be supporting Ukraine in any way. It is a very corrupt country.

to build a base in the disputed South China Sea, a Chinese navy general said in an interview published Tuesday, as Beijing seeks to consolidate its sovereignty over the region.
The South China Sea is a vital maritime artery for global trade and home to some of the world’s richest fishing grounds. China claims almost the entire body of water, a position that has sparked disputes with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.
Rear Admiral Peng Junxian said Beijing would “resolutely” “fulfill the duty to safeguard the country’s maritime security, and build a few garrisons, which are mainly used for security and defence purposes, to better protect our country’s maritime rights and interests,” according to the People’s Liberation Army newspaper, the PLA Daily.
The wall of sand and soil is only 12 miles off the coast of the Philippines. It is believed that the reefs could be rich in oil and gas.
The reclamation has been described as an “unprecedented” land reclamation project by environmentalists and has sparked strong criticism by neighboring countries.
The Philippine government has said it plans to hire a U.S. contractor to build a port on the key artificial island.
The project is funded by a $500 million grant from China, according to the Chinese embassy in Manila, a move that saw the Philippines formally protest to Beijing.
China has also been accused of violating the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea by building the island.
China has recently dispatched ships to move rocks and sand from the reefs to the island to build an airstrip.
The Manila government has also raised concerns that the island could be used as a military base by Beijing.
The Chinese embassy in Manila has repeatedly dismissed the allegations as unfounded.

it out
Thieu's administration had no success in rebuilding Vietnam. The economy was in ruin, and the people were increasingly impoverished, sick, and disenchanted. Thieu was infamous for his corruption and nepotism. His regime was undermined by a major drug-fueled scandal in 1973, which collapsed the National Assembly and forced the resignation of the prime minister, Pham Van Dong. Although the United States continued to send aid to Thieu, it became increasingly clear that his administration was not salvageable. In 1975, with the United States out of the war, Thieu lost the support of the United States, and his regime fell to the North. Thieu fled for Taiwan, where he and his family live in exile to this day.
In the years after the war, the Vietnamese divided into two camps. Most of the population identified with the South Vietnamese government and opposed communism. However, the majority of the country's intellectual elite supported the Communists. The intellectuals believed that modernity required the adoption of Marxism-Leninism, and that this was the only way to modernize Vietnam. The intellectuals were not thinking realistically. It was not until the 1980s that the government began to modernize Vietnam.
