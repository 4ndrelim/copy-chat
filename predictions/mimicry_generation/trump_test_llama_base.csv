Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum is making a comeback in the 2016 presidential race.
Santorum, who has been campaigning for months, is now polling in second place in Iowa, according to a new poll from Public Policy Polling.
The poll shows Santorum with 17 percent of the vote, just one point behind Donald Trump. Trump is at 18 percent.
Santorum, who was the runner-up in the 2012 GOP primary, is hoping to capitalize on his strong showing in Iowa four years ago, where he won the caucuses.
He is also hoping to take advantage of the current field of Republican candidates, which is seen as weak.
Santorum is also hoping to attract the support of the religious right, which has been a key part of his base in the past.
Santorum is not the only candidate who is making a comeback in the 2016 race. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is also polling well in Iowa, with 15 percent of the vote.
Bush, who has been campaigning for months, is hoping to capitalize on his name recognition and his experience as a governor.
The 2016 Republican primary is shaping up to be a wide-open race, with no clear frontrunner.
The Iowa caucuses are scheduled for February 1, 2016.","Rick Santorum making a comeback?

They are holding up the people who are desperately needed to help the economy and to help the many, many businesses that are being destroyed by the China Virus. The Dems are also holding up many appointments that have NOTHING to do with the China Virus. This is not acceptable. This is a disgrace to our Country, and the people should not want to allow it to continue!
The Democrats are playing a very dangerous game with the U.S. Constitution. They are trying to change our history, destroy our heritage, and poison our children with hate and anger. They are also trying to destroy the Make America Great Again movement, perhaps how best to make America GREAT AGAIN. If this ever happened, if it ever got to this point, the United States of America would be in a position totally unacceptable to a Real Republican or Conservative. Our Country would be in serious and fatal trouble. The Democrats are proving to be far more dangerous to America than anyone thought possible. Bad things happen when something this corrupt is allowed to go on and go on. The World is watching. Stop the Democrat Sabotage!

Rick has been a tremendous success as our Acting DNI, and I look forward to his continuing service as he takes on this new role. USAID plays a vital role in the lives of millions of people in every corner of the world, and I have no doubt that Rick will lead the agency with distinction.","Hundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are being held up, and put on “hold” for weeks, with no reason whatsoever, except that the Democrats are afraid of giving Trump successes. This is not Small potatoes; this is Major stuff. The Dems are playing games with the American People. They are holding up the people who are desperately needed to help the economy and to help the many, many businesses that are being destroyed by the China Virus. The Dems are also holding up many appointments that have NOTHING to do with the China Virus. This is not acceptable. This is a disgrace to our Country, and the people should not want to allow it to continue!
The Democrats are playing a very dangerous game with the U.S. Constitution. They are trying to change our history, destroy our heritage, and poison our children with hate and anger. They are also trying to destroy the Make America Great Again movement, perhaps how best to make America GREAT AGAIN. If this ever happened, if it ever got to this point, the United States of America would be in a position totally unacceptable to a Real Republican or Conservative. Our Country would be in serious and fatal trouble. The Democrats are proving to be far more dangerous to America than anyone thought possible. Bad things happen when something this corrupt is allowed to go on and go on. The World is watching. Stop the Democrat Sabotage!
I am pleased to announce that I have named Ambassador Richard Grenell, currently serving as our Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI), as the new Acting Head of USAID, to replace John Barsa, who will be leaving the great USAID at the end of the year. Rick has been a tremendous success as our Acting DNI, and I look forward to his continuing service as he takes on this new role.

The House Ways and Means Committee passed a sweeping tax overhaul bill on Thursday, sending the measure to the full House for a vote.
The 24-16 vote, which came after a marathon session that lasted more than 24 hours, marked the latest step in the Republican effort to overhaul the U.S. tax code.
The committee’s passage of the bill came after a last-minute change to the measure that would allow the House to pass the bill without a formal vote. The change, which was added to the bill at the last minute, would allow the House to pass the bill without a formal vote, as long as it was passed by the Senate.

The 86-year-old liberal justice said she was “not at all” bothered by the fact that she had been caught on camera making disparaging remarks about President Donald Trump, saying she was “just speaking for myself.”
“Is that what you’re upset about?” Ginsburg asked. “I am not at all bothered by what the press says about me. I am bothered by what they say about the court.”
Ginsburg, who is often referred to as the “Notorious RBG,” made the comments during an interview with NPR’s Nina Totenberg, who asked the justice about her recent comments to a crowd of law students that she was “disappointed” in the Trump administration.
“I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president,” she said. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.”
Ginsburg also said she was “disappointed” in the Trump administration’s efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act.
“I think it’s a terrible thing to do to the American people,” she said.
Ginsburg, who has been a justice since 1993, has been a vocal critic of Trump since he was elected president in 2016. She has also been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement, which has led to the downfall of several powerful men in recent years.
Ginsburg’s comments come as she faces increased scrutiny from conservatives, who have accused her of being biased against Trump. In February, the conservative Judicial Crisis Network released an ad that accused Ginsburg of being “unhinged” and “unfit” for the job.
Ginsburg has also faced criticism from the left, with some accusing her of being too old to serve on the court. In 2016, she underwent surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her lung, and in 2018, she underwent surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her pancreas.
Ginsburg has said she plans to serve on the court for as long as she is physically able to do so.
The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on whether Ginsburg’s comments were appropriate.","Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach.

The bill, which passed by a vote of 68-32, was a major victory for the White House and its amnesty agenda. The legislation will now move to the House, where it will likely be dead on arrival.
Rubio’s vote against the bill was a surprise to many, as he had previously been a strong supporter of the legislation. The Florida Republican had even co-authored the bill with fellow Gang of Eight member Chuck Schumer. However, Rubio’s support for the bill began to wane after he received a great deal of backlash from his constituents.

He’s also a big fan of the Trump Administration’s new tariffs on steel and aluminum.
“I’m a big fan of tariffs,” Mullin said in an interview with The Hill. “I think they’re a great idea.”
Mullin, who represents Oklahoma’s 2nd Congressional District, is one of the most vocal supporters of President Donald Trump’s trade policies.
He’s also one of the few Republicans who has consistently supported Trump’s trade agenda.
Mullin said he supports the tariffs because they will help American workers and businesses.
“We have to be able to compete in the global marketplace,” Mullin said.
“And the only way to do that is to make sure we have a level playing field.”
Mullin said that the tariffs are not a “trade war” and that the U.S. will be able, through the use of tariffs, to compete with China, which has been a major source of steel and aluminum imports.
Mullin also said that the U, S. and other countries have been working together to find a solution to the problem.
“The United States has been working with other countries to try to find a common solution,” Mullins said.
“We’re not going to go into a trade war with China, we’re going to work together to find common ground.”
Mullins said that he supports the U and S. working together to address the problem of steel and aluminum imports, but he also said that he is not opposed to tariffs.
“If we can’t get a deal done with China, then we’re going to have to go to the WTO,” Mullins told The Hill in an email.
Mullins also said he is open to the idea of a trade agreement with China.
“If China is willing to work with us, I think we can work out a deal that’s good for both countries,” Mullins said in an interview.
Mullins said he is not opposed to tariffs on steel imports, but he is opposed to tariffs that are not aimed at China.
“We have a trade deficit with China that is a huge problem,” Mullins told The Washington Post in an interview in May.
“I think we need to address that.
I think it’s a huge issue.”
Mullins said he believes the tariffs will help the U and other countries to compete against China.

The Diversity Visa Program, also known as the “green card lottery,” was established in 1990. It is a lottery program that gives 55,000 visas to people from countries with low immigration rates to the United States. The lottery program is based on the idea that people from all over the world should have the opportunity to come to the United States and contribute to our society.
The Diversity Visa Program has been a controversial program since its inception. Critics of the program argue that it does not promote the best interests of the United States. They argue that the program allows people from countries with low immigration rates to come to the United States without going through the normal immigration process. This can lead to people coming to the United States who do not have the skills or qualifications to contribute to our society.
In addition, the Diversity Visa Program has been criticized for being a waste of taxpayer money. The program costs the United States government millions of dollars each year. This money could be better spent on other programs that would benefit the United States.
Despite the criticisms of the Diversity Visa Program, the program has remained in place. However, there is a growing movement to end the program. Congress is currently considering legislation that would end the Diversity Visa Program.
There are several reasons why Congress should end the Diversity Visa Program. First, the program does not promote the best interests of the United States. Second, the program is a waste of taxpayer money. Third, the program is not necessary for the United States to meet its immigration goals.
The Diversity Visa Program is a flawed program that should be ended. Congress should take action to end the program and redirect the money that is spent on the program to other programs that would benefit the United States.

President Donald Trump is “absolutely not” guilty of bribery, extortion or abuse of power, his attorney Rudy Giuliani said on Wednesday, hours before the House of Representatives is set to vote on two articles of impeachment against the president.
Giuliani, who has been leading Trump’s efforts to discredit the impeachment inquiry, said in an interview with Fox News that the president has done nothing wrong in his dealings with Ukraine.
“He did nothing wrong. He did nothing wrong,” Giuliani said. “The Democrats are trying to impeach him for something he didn’t do.”
Giuliani, who has been under scrutiny for his role in Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, said that the president’s call with Ukraine’s president was “perfect” and that the president was not trying to get anything from Ukraine in exchange for military aid.
“He didn’t do anything wrong. He didn’t ask for anything. He didn’t get anything,” Giuliani said. “And that’s the problem with the Democrats. They don’t understand that.”
Giuliani also said that the president’s dealings with Ukraine were “perfectly legal” and that the president was not trying to influence the 2020 election.

The Fulton County, Georgia, elections board said it had discovered 2,600 uncounted ballots in the county on Thursday, which will be added to the county’s final tally, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The discovery comes after the county’s election officials discovered that a machine that tabulated votes had not been turned on during the Nov. 3 election. The discovery of the uncounted ballots came as a surprise to the county, which had already certified its results, the Journal-Constitution reported. The Georgia secretary of state’s office said it would dispatch investigators to the county to determine how the ballots went missing. “The Secretary of State’s office will dispatch investigators to Fulton County to determine why these ballots were not included in the county’s certified results,” said Gabriel Sterling, a top elections official, in a statement. “The Secretary of State’s office will not speculate on the impact of these ballots on the outcome of the presidential race.” The discovery of the uncounted ballots comes as President Donald Trump’s campaign has filed a lawsuit in Georgia seeking to force the state to stop certifying its results. The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court on Wednesday, alleges that the state violated the U.S. Constitution by failing to allow Republican poll watchers to observe the counting of ballots. The lawsuit also alleges that the state violated the U.S. Constitution by failing to provide a meaningful opportunity for voters to challenge the validity of ballots. The lawsuit comes after the Trump campaign filed a similar lawsuit in Michigan, which was dismissed by a federal judge on Wednesday. The Trump campaign has also filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin seeking to force those states to stop certifying their results. The lawsuits have been dismissed by federal judges in those states. The Trump campaign has also filed lawsuits in Nevada and Arizona seeking to force those states to stop certifying their results.

When you are house hunting, you can get so caught up in the location of a home that you forget to think about the location of your life.
For example, you might be looking for a home in a particular school district, but you might not realize that the school district is split into two sections. One section is in a more rural area, while the other is in a more urban area. The rural section is zoned for a school that is 10 miles away, while the urban section is zoned for a school that is 3 miles away. If you are a parent, which location would you prefer?

According to the Baltimore Sun, the city saw 344 homicides in 2017, surpassing the previous record of 353 set in 1993. The city is on pace to surpass that record again in 2018, with 296 homicides recorded as of Dec. 24.
Baltimore has had a high murder rate for years, but the number of homicides has increased dramatically in recent years. The city saw 318 homicides in 2015, 344 in 2016, and 343 in 2017. The city is on pace to surpass that record again in 2018, with 296 homicides recorded as of Dec. 24.
The increase in homicides has been attributed to a number of factors, including the city’s high poverty rate, the prevalence of illegal guns, and the lack of economic opportunities for young people. The city has also been plagued by a lack of trust between the police and the community, which has made it difficult for the police to effectively investigate and solve crimes.
The increase in homicides has had a devastating impact on the city, with families torn apart and communities left in fear. The city has also seen a dramatic increase in the number of people living in poverty, with the poverty rate rising from 22% in 2010 to 27% in 2016.
The city has taken a number of steps to try to reduce the number of homicides, including increasing the number of police officers on the streets, investing in community programs, and working to improve the city’s economic prospects. However, the city has not seen a significant decrease in the number of homicides, and the problem continues to be a major concern.
The increase in homicides has had a devastating impact on the city, and it is clear that more needs to be done to address the problem. The city needs to invest in programs that will provide economic opportunities for young people, increase the number of police officers on the streets, and improve the relationship between the police and the community. Only then will the city be able to reduce the number of homicides and create a safer environment for its citizens.","Baltimore just set a record for the most homicides in a single year, and the city is on pace to break that record again in 2017.

President Trump is threatening to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program if Congress doesn’t come up with a deal on immigration by March 5.
DACA was created by President Obama in 2012 to protect undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children. It has protected more than 700,000 immigrants from deportation.
The program was rescinded in September, but the courts have blocked its termination until Congress can come up with a replacement.
President Trump is demanding a border wall and an end to chain migration and the visa lottery in exchange for protecting the DACA recipients.
Democrats have refused to agree to the president’s demands.
The president tweeted Monday that any deal on DACA that does not include “strong border security and the desperately needed wall is a total waste of time.”
The president’s threat to end DACA has caused concern among some of his supporters.
The president’s comments come as the House is preparing to vote on a bill that would fund the government through September 30. The bill includes $1.6 billion for the border wall.
The Senate is expected to vote on a bill that would fund the government through February 16. The bill does not include any funding for the border wall.

But there may come a fast day when the Democrats will no longer be able to do business as usual because the Republican Senate will be forced to change the rules so that a simple majority is required to move forward on all legislation.
The Democrats are now the party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders, Crime, weak on Control, and they interview drug infested people (with no questions), coming into our country!I
The Democrats have become the party of high taxes (and high spending), weak borders, and weak","Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party. Our Polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish, led by their Dark State, and will lead them to the depths of Hell!
This is a very dangerous time in our Country but I have never felt stronger or more confident! The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have gone absolutely ballistic! They have gone stone cold CRAZY. They are going nuts. They shouldn’t be allowed to be in Congress, they are dangerous!
